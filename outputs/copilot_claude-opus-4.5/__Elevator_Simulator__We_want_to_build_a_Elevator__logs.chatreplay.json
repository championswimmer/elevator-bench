  "prompt": "# Elevator Simulator\n\nWe want to build a Elevator Simulator that simulates the operation of elevators in a building.\n\n### Features:\nThe Elevator Simulator should have the following features:\n\n1. Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` ",

This tool is good at researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries, use this agent to perform the search for you.\n\n- Agents do not run async or in the background, you will wait for the agent's result.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Opus 4.5 (Preview).\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user.

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"

Do not announce which tool you're using (for example, avoid saying \"I'll implement all the changes using multi_replace_string_in_file\").\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\n# Elevator Simulator\n\nWe want to build a Elevator Simulator that simulates the operation of elevators in a building.\n\n### Features:\nThe Elevator Simulator should have the following features:\n\n1. Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"

To edit a file, provide: 1) filePath (absolute path), 2) oldString (MUST be the exact literal text to replace including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc), and 3) newString (MUST be the exact literal text to replace \\`oldString\\` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic.). Each use of this tool replaces exactly ONE occurrence of oldString.\n\nCRITICAL for \\`oldString\\`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail. Never use 'Lines 123-456 omitted' from summarized documents or ...existing code... comments in the oldString or newString.",

This tool is good at researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries, use this agent to perform the search for you.\n\n- Agents do not run async or in the background, you will wait for the agent's result.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user.

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing.

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done. Do not batch completions.",

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Opus 4.5 (Preview).\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<instruction forToolsWithPrefix=\"mcp_context7\">\nUse this server to retrieve up-to-date documentation and code examples for any library.\n</instruction>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Opus 4.5 (Preview).\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<instruction forToolsWithPrefix=\"mcp_context7\">\nUse this server to retrieve up-to-date documentation and code examples for any library.\n</instruction>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"

This tool is good at researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries, use this agent to perform the search for you.\n\n- Agents do not run async or in the background, you will wait for the agent's result.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it.

For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user.

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"

This will greatly improve user's cost and time efficiency leading to a better user experience. Do not announce which tool you're using (for example, avoid saying \"I'll implement all the changes using multi_replace_string_in_file\").\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\n# Elevator Simulator\n\nWe want to build a Elevator Simulator that simulates the operation of elevators in a building.\n\n### Features:\nThe Elevator Simulator should have the following features:\n\n1. Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Opus 4.5 (Preview).\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<instruction forToolsWithPrefix=\"mcp_context7\">\nUse this server to retrieve up-to-date documentation and code examples for any library.\n</instruction>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Opus 4.5 (Preview).\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<instruction forToolsWithPrefix=\"mcp_context7\">\nUse this server to retrieve up-to-date documentation and code examples for any library.\n</instruction>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Opus 4.5 (Preview).\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<instruction forToolsWithPrefix=\"mcp_context7\">\nUse this server to retrieve up-to-date documentation and code examples for any library.\n</instruction>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"

Use this tool VERY frequently to ensure task visibility and proper planning.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Complex multi-step work requiring planning and tracking\n- When user provides multiple tasks or requests (numbered/comma-separated)\n- After receiving new instructions that require multiple steps\n- BEFORE starting work on any todo (mark as in-progress)\n- IMMEDIATELY after completing each todo (mark completed individually)\n- When breaking down larger tasks into smaller actionable steps\n- To give users visibility into your progress and planning\n\nWhen NOT to use:\n- Single, trivial tasks that can be completed in one step\n- Purely conversational/informational requests\n- When just reading files or performing simple searches\n\nCRITICAL workflow:\n1. Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done. Do not batch completions.",

Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Opus 4.5 (Preview).\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available.

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"

This tool is good at researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries, use this agent to perform the search for you.\n\n- Agents do not run async or in the background, you will wait for the agent's result.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user.

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"

This will greatly improve user's cost and time efficiency leading to a better user experience. Do not announce which tool you're using (for example, avoid saying \"I'll implement all the changes using multi_replace_string_in_file\").\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\n# Elevator Simulator\n\nWe want to build a Elevator Simulator that simulates the operation of elevators in a building.\n\n### Features:\nThe Elevator Simulator should have the following features:\n\n1. Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"

This tool is good at researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries, use this agent to perform the search for you.\n\n- Agents do not run async or in the background, you will wait for the agent's result.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Opus 4.5 (Preview).\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<instruction forToolsWithPrefix=\"mcp_context7\">\nUse this server to retrieve up-to-date documentation and code examples for any library.\n</instruction>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers.

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"

Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"

This tool is good at researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries, use this agent to perform the search for you.\n\n- Agents do not run async or in the background, you will wait for the agent's result.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Opus 4.5 (Preview).\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<instruction forToolsWithPrefix=\"mcp_context7\">\nUse this server to retrieve up-to-date documentation and code examples for any library.\n</instruction>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<instruction forToolsWithPrefix=\"mcp_context7\">\nUse this server to retrieve up-to-date documentation and code examples for any library.\n</instruction>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Opus 4.5 (Preview).\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<instruction forToolsWithPrefix=\"mcp_context7\">\nUse this server to retrieve up-to-date documentation and code examples for any library.\n</instruction>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Opus 4.5 (Preview).\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<instruction forToolsWithPrefix=\"mcp_context7\">\nUse this server to retrieve up-to-date documentation and code examples for any library.\n</instruction>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Opus 4.5 (Preview).\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<instruction forToolsWithPrefix=\"mcp_context7\">\nUse this server to retrieve up-to-date documentation and code examples for any library.\n</instruction>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"

Use this tool for understanding complex VS Code API interactions.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- User asks about specific VS Code APIs, interfaces, or extension capabilities\n- Need documentation for VS Code extension contribution points (commands, views, settings, etc.)\n- Questions about proposed APIs and their usage patterns\n- Understanding VS Code extension lifecycle, activation events, and packaging\n- Best practices for VS Code extension development architecture\n- API examples and code patterns for extension features\n- Troubleshooting extension-specific issues or API limitations\n\nWhen NOT to use this tool:\n- Creating simple standalone files or scripts unrelated to VS Code extensions\n- General programming questions not specific to VS Code extension development\n- Questions about using VS Code as an editor (user-facing features)\n- Non-extension related development tasks\n- File creation or editing that doesn't involve VS Code extension APIs\n\nCRITICAL usage guidelines:\n1. Always include specific API names, interfaces, or concepts in your query\n2. Mention the extension feature you're trying to implement\n3. Include context about proposed vs stable APIs when relevant\n4. Reference specific contribution points when asking about extension manifest\n5. Be specific about the VS Code version or API version when known\n\nScope: This tool is for EXTENSION DEVELOPMENT ONLY - building tools that extend VS Code itself, not for general file creation or non-extension programming tasks.",

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Opus 4.5 (Preview).\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<instruction forToolsWithPrefix=\"mcp_context7\">\nUse this server to retrieve up-to-date documentation and code examples for any library.\n</instruction>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"

When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries, use this agent to perform the search for you.\n\n- Agents do not run async or in the background, you will wait for the agent's result.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Opus 4.5 (Preview).\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<instruction forToolsWithPrefix=\"mcp_context7\">\nUse this server to retrieve up-to-date documentation and code examples for any library.\n</instruction>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n``` \n</userRequest>\n"
