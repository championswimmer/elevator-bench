      "prompt": "# Elevator Simulator\n\nWe want to build a Elevator Simulator that simulates the operation of elevators in a building.\n\n### Features:\nThe Elevator Simulator should have the following features:\n\n1. Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbun ./index.html --port XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```",

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbun ./index.html --port XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbun ./index.html --port XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbun ./index.html --port XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbun ./index.html --port XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbun ./index.html --port XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbun ./index.html --port XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

Always include specific API names, interfaces, or concepts in your query\n2. Mention the extension feature you're trying to implement\n3. Include context about proposed vs stable APIs when relevant\n4. Reference specific contribution points when asking about extension manifest\n5.

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbun ./index.html --port XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbun ./index.html --port XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbun ./index.html --port XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbun ./index.html --port XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbun ./index.html --port XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path.

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbun ./index.html --port XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers.

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbun ./index.html --port XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbun ./index.html --port XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```",

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

Always include specific API names, interfaces, or concepts in your query\n2. Mention the extension feature you're trying to implement\n3. Include context about proposed vs stable APIs when relevant\n4. Reference specific contribution points when asking about extension manifest\n5.

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers.

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers.

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

Always include specific API names, interfaces, or concepts in your query\n2. Mention the extension feature you're trying to implement\n3. Include context about proposed vs stable APIs when relevant\n4. Reference specific contribution points when asking about extension manifest\n5. Be specific about the VS Code version or API version when known\n\nScope: This tool is for EXTENSION DEVELOPMENT ONLY - building tools that extend VS Code itself, not for general file creation or non-extension programming tasks.",

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers.

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers.

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers.

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

Use this tool VERY frequently to ensure task visibility and proper planning.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Complex multi-step work requiring planning and tracking\n- When user provides multiple tasks or requests (numbered/comma-separated)\n- After receiving new instructions that require multiple steps\n- BEFORE starting work on any todo (mark as in-progress)\n- IMMEDIATELY after completing each todo (mark completed individually)\n- When breaking down larger tasks into smaller actionable steps\n- To give users visibility into your progress and planning\n\nWhen NOT to use:\n- Single, trivial tasks that can be completed in one step\n- Purely conversational/informational requests\n- When just reading files or performing simple searches\n\nCRITICAL workflow:\n1. Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical.

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers.

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

      "prompt": "# Elevator Simulator\n\nWe want to build a Elevator Simulator that simulates the operation of elevators in a building.\n\n### Features:\nThe Elevator Simulator should have the following features:\n\n1. Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2.

      "prompt": "# Elevator Simulator\n\nWe want to build a Elevator Simulator that simulates the operation of elevators in a building.\n\n### Features:\nThe Elevator Simulator should have the following features:\n\n1. Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing.

Use this tool VERY frequently to ensure task visibility and proper planning.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Complex multi-step work requiring planning and tracking\n- When user provides multiple tasks or requests (numbered/comma-separated)\n- After receiving new instructions that require multiple steps\n- BEFORE starting work on any todo (mark as in-progress)\n- IMMEDIATELY after completing each todo (mark completed individually)\n- When breaking down larger tasks into smaller actionable steps\n- To give users visibility into your progress and planning\n\nWhen NOT to use:\n- Single, trivial tasks that can be completed in one step\n- Purely conversational/informational requests\n- When just reading files or performing simple searches\n\nCRITICAL workflow:\n1. Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical.

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

      "prompt": "# Elevator Simulator\n\nWe want to build a Elevator Simulator that simulates the operation of elevators in a building.\n\n### Features:\nThe Elevator Simulator should have the following features:\n\n1. Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```",

Use this tool VERY frequently to ensure task visibility and proper planning.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Complex multi-step work requiring planning and tracking\n- When user provides multiple tasks or requests (numbered/comma-separated)\n- After receiving new instructions that require multiple steps\n- BEFORE starting work on any todo (mark as in-progress)\n- IMMEDIATELY after completing each todo (mark completed individually)\n- When breaking down larger tasks into smaller actionable steps\n- To give users visibility into your progress and planning\n\nWhen NOT to use:\n- Single, trivial tasks that can be completed in one step\n- Purely conversational/informational requests\n- When just reading files or performing simple searches\n\nCRITICAL workflow:\n1. Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path.

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

      "prompt": "# Elevator Simulator\n\nWe want to build a Elevator Simulator that simulates the operation of elevators in a building.\n\n### Features:\nThe Elevator Simulator should have the following features:\n\n1. Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```",

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers.

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages.

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Each floor should have up and down buttons to request an elevator. The top and bottom floors will only have one button (down for top floor, up for bottom floor).\n\n2. Floors start from 0 at bottom (ground floor) to N-1 at top (N is total number of floors).\n\n3. Inside each elevator, there should be buttons for each floor to select the desired destination.\n\n4. The simulation begins with all elevators idle at the ground floor (floor 0).\n\n5. The simulation should show the animation of the elevators moving from floor to floor.\nThe elevator logic should optimise for the following: \n\n  1. When an elevator is requested from a floor, the closest idle elevator travelling in the direction of the request should respond first.\n\n  2. If all elevators are busy, the request should be queued and assigned to the next available elevator.\n\n  3. Elevator should not change direction until all requests in the current direction are fulfilled, or it reaches the end of the building on either side.\n\n### Defaults: \nFor the purpose of this simulation we will consider this configuration as defaults (should all be configurable constants): \n\n1. Floors in building: 10 (numbered from 0 to 9)\n2. Number of Elevators: 4 (numbered from 0 to 3)\n\n\n### Code Structure: \n\nCreate 3 main files: \n\n1. index.html - This file will contain the HTML structure of the simulator. You can create divs for floors, elevators, and buttons here if you need.\n  1. Include the model, tool, and provider information from info.json\n  at the top after title in this HTML page.\n\n2. styles.css - This file will contain the CSS styles for the simulator to make it visually appealing. Use plain CSS, no SASS/SCSS.\n\n3. script.ts - This file will contain the TypeScript code to handle the elevator logic, button clicks, and state management of the elevators.\n  1. Creating further .ts files for Elevator, Floor, and Building classes is encouraged for better organization.\n  2. Make sure everything is imported directly/indirectly from script.ts so that bun build will include them in the final output.\n\n### Project Setup\n\nWe want this project to run & build using bun, without any package.json or node_modules dependencies. \n\nWe should be able to run the project using:\n\n```sh \nbunx serve -p XXXX\n```\nWhere port number `XXXX` is picked from info.json \n\nWe should be able to build the project using:\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist\n```\n</userRequest>\n"

              "Excellent! I've successfully created a complete Elevator Simulator with all the requested features:\n\n## ✅ What's Been Created:\n\n### **Core Files:**\n\n1. **`Elevator.ts`** - Manages individual elevator state, movement, direction logic, and visual updates\n2. **`Floor.ts`** - Handles floor buttons and request states\n3. **`Building.ts`** - Orchestrates all elevators, processes requests, and implements the smart elevator assignment logic\n4. **`script.ts`** - Main entry point that initializes and renders the simulation\n5. **`styles.css`** - Complete styling with animations and responsive design\n6. **`index.html`** - HTML structure with info.json data displayed at the top\n\n### **Features Implemented:**\n\n✅ **10 floors** (0-9) with up/down call buttons\n✅ **4 elevators** starting at ground floor\n✅ **Smart elevator logic:**\n   - Closest idle elevator responds first\n   - Moving elevators can pick up requests in same direction\n   - Request queuing when all elevators busy\n   - No direction change until all requests in current direction fulfilled\n\n✅ **Visual animations:**\n   - Smooth elevator movement between floors\n   - Color-coded states (Green=Idle, Blue=Moving, Orange=Stopped)\n   - Button press indicators\n   - Direction arrows\n\n✅ **Control panels** for each elevator with floor selection buttons\n\n✅ **Configuration info** from info.json displayed at the top\n\n### **Commands:**\n\n```sh\n# Build the project\nmkdir -p ./dist\nbun build ./script.ts --outdir ./dist\ncp index.html dist/ && cp styles.css dist/\n\n# Run the server\nbunx serve -p 8219\n```\n\nThe simulator is now **running at http://localhost:8219** and fully functional! You can test it by clicking floor call buttons and elevator control panel buttons to see the elevators respond intelligently to requests."
