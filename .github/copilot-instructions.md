# Copilot Custom Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a **benchmark repository** for comparing different AI code generation implementations of an Elevator Simulator. The repository contains multiple subdirectories, each representing an implementation generated by different AI models (e.g., `github-copilot-gpt-5-codex`, `deepseek-v3_2`, `glm-4_6`, etc.).

**Key Technologies:**
- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling and animations
- TypeScript/JavaScript for elevator logic
- Bun as the runtime and build tool

## Project Purpose
This is NOT a production application. It is a benchmark/comparison project to evaluate how different AI models implement the same specification (described in `PROMPT.md`).

## Required File Structure
Each implementation subdirectory must contain exactly 3 files:
1. `index.html` - HTML structure with floor buttons and elevator interface
2. `styles.css` - CSS styles and animations for the simulator
3. `script.ts` (or `script.js`) - TypeScript/JavaScript code for elevator logic

## Elevator Specification (from PROMPT.md)
**Defaults (all configurable constants):**
- 10 floors (numbered 0-9)
- 4 elevators (numbered 0-3)

**Features:**
- Each floor has up/down buttons (top floor only down, bottom floor only up)
- Each elevator has buttons for all floors
- All elevators start idle at ground floor (floor 0)
- Must show animation of elevators moving

**Optimization Logic:**
- When requested, closest idle elevator in the direction of request responds first
- If all busy, queue the request for next available elevator
- Elevators don't change direction until all requests in current direction are fulfilled

## Build & Run Commands
```sh
# Run the simulator (development mode)
bun ./index.html

# Build for production
mkdir -p ./dist
bun build ./index.html --outdir ./dist
```

## Coding Standards
- Keep code simple and readable - this is for demonstration/benchmarking
- Include comments only where necessary to explain complex logic
- Use modern JavaScript/TypeScript features (ES6+)
- Prefer functional approaches where appropriate
- Keep the three-file structure (index.html, styles.css, script.ts)

## File Organization
- Each AI implementation lives in its own subdirectory named after the model
- The root `PROMPT.md` contains the specification for all implementations
- `dist/` and `node_modules/` are gitignored
- Do NOT modify other implementations when working on a specific one

## Animation & UI
- Elevator movement should be smooth and visually clear
- Use CSS animations/transitions for elevator movement
- UI should clearly show:
  - Current floor of each elevator
  - Direction of travel
  - Active requests/buttons
  - Queue status if applicable

## Testing Approach
- This is a benchmark project, so automated tests are not required
- Manual testing by running `bun ./index.html` and interacting with the UI
- Verify elevator logic handles edge cases:
  - Multiple simultaneous requests
  - Requests while elevator is moving
  - Top/bottom floor button constraints

## What NOT to Do
- Don't add dependencies unless absolutely necessary
- Don't create package.json files unless specifically requested
- Don't add test frameworks or build tooling beyond what Bun provides
- Don't modify implementations in other subdirectories
- Don't add configuration files (tsconfig.json, etc.) unless needed for a specific implementation

## When Adding New Implementations
If creating a new implementation subdirectory:
1. Name it clearly after the AI model (e.g., `model-name-version`)
2. Include all three required files
3. Optionally add a README.md explaining any unique aspects
4. Ensure it runs with `bun ./index.html` from within that directory
