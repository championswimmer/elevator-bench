## FINAL OUTPUT 

Successfully created a complete Elevator Simulator with 10 floors and 4 elevators. The simulator includes:

**Core Features Implemented:**
- Floor request buttons (up/down) with proper direction logic
- Individual elevator controls with floor selection
- Visual animation of elevator movement
- Real-time status logging and display updates

**Elevator Logic:**
- Intelligent dispatching - closest idle elevator responds first
- Direction optimization - maintains direction until all requests fulfilled  
- Request queuing when all elevators busy
- Proper state management for each elevator

**Technical Details:**
- Built with TypeScript for type safety
- Responsive CSS design with modern styling
- Modular class-based architecture
- Successfully tested with bun run and build commands

**Files Created:**
- index.html: Complete HTML structure for simulator interface
- styles.css: Modern CSS with animations and responsive design  
- script.ts: Full TypeScript implementation with elevator logic

The simulator is running successfully on http://localhost:3000/ and ready for interaction. All elevator dispatching optimizations and visual features are working as specified.
